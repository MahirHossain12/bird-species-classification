## 🐦 Bird Species Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains a **deep learning-based image classification project** for predicting **bird species** from images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and classify various bird species with high accuracy.

Implemented entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, this project is ideal for bird watchers, ecology researchers, and developers working on biodiversity monitoring using computer vision.

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Image Classification** using transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50)
* 🐦 Supports classification of **multiple bird species**
* 📁 Works with **custom datasets** of bird images
* 📊 Displays **model performance metrics** (accuracy, loss) with visual plots
* 📸 **Real-time predictions** on new images via upload
* 💻 Fully executable in **Google Colab** or local Jupyter Notebook

---

### 📁 Project Structure

* `Bird_Species_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook containing model training, evaluation, and prediction pipeline.
* `/data`: Folder for training/validation/testing datasets (organized by class name).
* `/saved_model`: Directory to save or load trained models.
* `/sample_predictions`: Folder containing sample images and prediction outputs.
* `requirements.txt`: Python libraries needed (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)

### 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MahirHossain12/bird-species-classification.git
   cd bird-species-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
